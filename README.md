# Real-time Object Detection and Tracking for Video Surveillance

## Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system for video surveillance applications. The system is capable of detecting multiple objects in a live video stream and tracking them across frames, maintaining their identities even with occlusions or temporary disappearances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   PyTorch (with CUDA support if using GPUs)
*   OpenCV
*   Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd object-detection-tracking
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    # Using Conda:
    conda create -n object_tracking python=3.9
    conda activate object_tracking

    # Or, using virtualenv:
    virtualenv envs/object_tracking_env
    source envs/object_tracking_env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dataset

*   The dataset used for this project is \[Dataset Name] (link to dataset if available).
*   Place the dataset in the `data/raw` folder, following the structure:
    ```
    data/
    └── raw/
        ├── train/
        │   ├── images/
        │   └── labels/
        └── test/
            ├── images/
            └── labels/
    ```

### Running the Project

*   **Training the Object Detection Model:**
    \[Instructions on how to train the object detection model, including any necessary scripts or commands.]

*   **Running Object Detection and Tracking:**
    \[Instructions on how to run the real-time object detection and tracking pipeline, including how to specify the input video source (camera or file).]

*   **Evaluation:**
    \[Instructions on how to evaluate the performance of the system using metrics like mAP and MOTA.]

## Model and Algorithms

*   **Object Detection:** \[Name of the object detection model used] (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN)
*   **Object Tracking:** \[Name of the tracking algorithm used] (e.g., DeepSORT, Kalman Filter)

## Results

\[Placeholder for presenting the results of your project. You can include tables, graphs, and images to showcase the performance of your system. For example, you might show mAP scores for object detection and MOTA/MOTP/IDF1 scores for tracking.]

## Future Work

*   \[List of potential future improvements or extensions to the project. For example:]
    *   Integrate a natural language interface for controlling the system.
    *   Implement anomaly detection to flag unusual object behavior.
    *   Add support for different object classes and tracking scenarios.
    *   Improve the speed and efficiency of the system for real-time performance on edge devices.
